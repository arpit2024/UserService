In UserService Class
--------------------------------
when i try to Autowire the BcryptPasswordEncoder to encode a password, i get the following error:
public UserService(UserRepository userRepository,BCryptPasswordEncoder bCryptPasswordEncoder){
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
        this.bCryptPasswordEncoder = bCryptPasswordEncoder;
    }
its is giving error or not able to Autowire it,
Q)what gets Autowire
->if there is a particular object that is currently not getting autowired than how can we
automatically
wire it/How did we get RestTemplate present in every place
->By using a configuration class and using @Bean annotation we can Autowire it


Spring Security
-----------------
Q)What is Spring Security
->Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework
 Java applications

when an APi request is done , i get 401 unauthorized error
-> Spring security it automatically adds a restriction that only if a person is logged in will be
able to access the API/call the controller method

But for my SignUp API i cannot except a user to be logged in for the first time to call
the SignUp API
->So we need to disable the Spring Security for the SignUp API- so create a class called SecurityConfig
